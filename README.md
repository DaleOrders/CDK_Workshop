# Deploying a Cloudfront Simple Static Website on AWS with CDK and TypeScript

This workshop sdemonstrates how to create and deploy a simple static website using AWS CDK with TypeScript. The project will cover:

- Initializing a basic AWS CDK project structure.
- Defining infrastructure as code (IaC) with TypeScript.
- Creating AWS resources necessary for hosting a static website.
- Deploying the website to AWS.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (>= 14.x)
- **AWS CLI** (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- **AWS CDK** (>= 2.x)

To install AWS CDK globally:

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

---

## Step 1: Initialize the Project

1. **Create a project directory** and navigate to it:

   ```bash
   mkdir cdk-workshop && cd cdk-workshop
   ```

2. **Initialize a new CDK app**:

   ```bash
   cdk init app --language typescript
   ```

3. Update aws-cdk-lib to the latest version:


   ```bash
   npm install aws-cdk-lib@latest
   ```

4. Install dependencies for the CDK constructs we'll use:

   ```bash
   3. npm install constructs@latest
   ```

CDK Dependencies as shown in the package.json file

## Step 2: Create a Simple Website

1. **Download the website template from [html5up.net](https://html5up.net/dimension/download)**:

2. unzip the file, navigate to the folder and manually copy all the files to a new folder called 'website' in your project or run the following command.

```bash
cp -r ~/Downloads/html5up-dimension $(pwd)/website/
```

---

## Step 3: Write CDK Code to Host the Website

Edit the `bin/cdk-workshop.ts` to explicity set the aws region to be ap-southeast-2:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { S3StaticWebsiteStack } from '../lib/cdk-workshop-stack';

const app = new cdk.App();
new S3StaticWebsiteStack (app, 'CdkWorkshopStack', {
env: { region: 'ap-southeast-2' },
});
```

Edit the `lib/cdk-s3-website-stack.ts` file to define the an S3 bucket and deploy the website under './website' folder:

```typescript
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { Construct } from 'constructs';
import { Bucket, BlockPublicAccess } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';
import { BucketDeployment, Source } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3-deployment';
import { Distribution, ViewerProtocolPolicy } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront';
import { S3Origin } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cloudfront-origins';

export class S3StaticWebsiteStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Create an S3 bucket for the static website
    const websiteBucket = new Bucket(this, 'StaticWebsiteBucket', {
      websiteIndexDocument: 'index.html',
      removalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.DESTROY, // Only for dev environments, not recommended for prod
      autoDeleteObjects: true, // Automatically deletes objects when the bucket is destroyed (for dev environments)
      blockPublicAccess: BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ACLS, // Block ACL-based public access
      publicReadAccess: true
    });

    // Deploy local files to the S3 bucket
    new BucketDeployment(this, 'DeployWebsite', {
      sources: [Source.asset('./website')], // Path to your local website files
      destinationBucket: websiteBucket,
    });


    // Output the website URL
    new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'WebsiteURL', {
      value: websiteBucket.bucketWebsiteUrl,
      description: 'The website URL',});
      
  }
}
```

---

## Step 5: Run the following curl command to generate AWS user credientials




---

## Step 6: Deploy the Website

Run the following commands to deploy your website:

1. **Bootstrap the environment**:

   ```bash
   cdk bootstrap
   ```


2. **Synthethize the cloudtemplate template**:

   ```bash
   cdk synth
   ```



During deployment, the CDK will output the URL for the hosted website. You can access your site using this URL.

## Full Command History


---

## Clean Up

To avoid incurring unnecessary charges, delete the stack. If the `cdk destroy` command fails due to non-empty buckets, empty the bucket manually or use the `autoDeleteObjects` property in your stack as shown above:

1. **Manually empty the bucket**:

   ```bash
   aws s3 rm s3://<bucket-name> --recursive
   ```

2. **Destroy the stack**:

   ```bash
   cdk destroy
   ```

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated how to use AWS CDK with TypeScript to deploy a simple static website on AWS. The focus was on showcasing the CDKâ€™s capabilities for infrastructure provisioning and deployment automation. You can now customize and expand upon this setup for more complex use cases.
